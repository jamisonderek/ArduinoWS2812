# ArduinoWS2812

## Overview
For our 2020 Christmas tree, we wrapped a 16.4 foot LED strip (WS2812) and connected the end of
the LED string to a breadboard with ATtiny85 that controlled our star (running on AC voltage).
This is a sample of some of the effects we used (some effects are focused on the LED strip and
some are focused on the star.)
